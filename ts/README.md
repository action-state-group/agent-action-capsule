# Agent Action Capsule TypeScript reference

This package is the record-format reference conforming to the Python authority
in this repository. It implements strict JSON/JCS, format-4 Capsule IDs, the
typed record model, Class-1 and `references[]` verification, registries,
Producer Envelopes, and Disclosure Envelopes through DE-3. It intentionally
does not contain producer verbs, CLL storage, policy, adapters, or permalink
transport.

The Node entry requires Node.js 20 or newer. Bundlers using the `browser`
condition resolve a WebCrypto-only verification entry; it excludes the
Node-only Producer Envelope signing and key-creation APIs while retaining
`verifyProducerEnvelope`.

Digest-dependent APIs are async: await `sha256Hex`, `jsonDigest`,
`computeCapsuleId`, `verifyClass1`, `verifyStore`,
`verifyDisclosureEnvelope`, `sealCapsule`, and `parseCapsule`.
`verifyProducerEnvelope` is also async on both entry points.

```bash
npm ci
npm run check
```

The tests consume the same-commit corpora under `../vectors/`.
