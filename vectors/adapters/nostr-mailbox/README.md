# Nostr mailbox carriage vectors (EXPERIMENTAL)

Vectors for `spec/bindings/nostr-mailbox-v0.md`, an experimental carriage of the
`evidence-interop/0` exchange through a Nostr relay, and its adapter declaration
`spec/adapters/nostr-mailbox-v0.md`. The binding is not part of `evidence-interop/0` and has no
binding token. These vectors are not conformance vectors for that profile.

- `vectors.json`: the cases (binding §9). Each carries the request octets, the request event, the
  events a relay delivered, and, where the window closed with no reply, the absence record, with
  the expected classification of each event and the expected verifier results.
- `manifest.json`: the set, its status and the SHA-256 of each generated file.
- `SHA256SUMS`: every file here.

The envelopes, refusal, keys, log and contract pin are those of `vectors/interop-profile-v0/`.
Every Nostr key is a test key derived from a public label (`nostr_test_keys` in `vectors.json`).
The events are constructed. No relay was contacted, and `wss://relay.example` is an example name.

Regenerate with `python python/scripts/generate_nostr_mailbox_vectors.py`; check with
`pytest python/tests/test_nostr_mailbox_vectors.py`. The workflow
`.github/workflows/nostr-mailbox.yml` fails when a regeneration differs from these files.
